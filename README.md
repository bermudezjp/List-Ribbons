This is the json code for a sharepoint list


Hi I just wanted to share a really useful repository that I found to create a list on SharePoint, it can definitely be really useful and make SharePoint Sites more interactive. 

I used it to create a menu with 5 options on this SharePoint about LA Innovation Projects, you can find a lot of interactive and creative ways of making a list with the
code here, you can use my code if you want to make a similar type of menu with picture, url and a hover effect, you just need to create a table with the necessary 
information selected as "Tiles" and start formatting the list using json.

Microsoft also has a lot of documentation on this topic here too.

I'm gonna add this likes here:

https://github.com/pnp/List-Formatting/tree/master/column-samples -> a lot of examples of list formmating with json
https://pgone.sharepoint.com/sites/LASupplyChainDataAnalytics -> the website where this list was applied
